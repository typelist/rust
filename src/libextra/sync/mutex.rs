//! A proper mutex implementation regardless of the "flavor of task" which is
//! acquiring the lock.

// # The implementation of Rust's mutexes
//
// As hinted in the doc-comment above, the fundamental problem of implementing a
// mutex for rust is that you can't "just use pthreads". Green tasks are not
// allowed to block on a pthread mutex, because this can very easily lead to
// deadlock. Otherwise, there are other properties that we would want out of an
// "official mutex":
//
// * Any flavor of task can acquire the mutex, green or native
// * Any mixing of flavors of tasks can acquire the mutex. It should be possible
//   for green and native threads to contend over acquiring the mutex
// * This mutex should be "just as fast" as pthreads
// * Mutexes should be statically initializeable
// * Mutexes should really not need to have destructors (see static
//   initialization)
//
// Some properties which have been deemed not critical
//
// * Enforcing bounded waiting among all tasks acquiring the mutex. Mixing
//   green/native tasks is predicted to be a fairly rare case.
//
// ## Mutexes, take 1
//
// Within these constraints, the primitives we have available to us for blocking
// a task are the `deschedule` and `reawaken` methods on the `rt::Runtime`
// trait. These are the obvious choices to use first because they're "what we
// havel already" and should certainly be efficient.
//
// The sketch behind this mutex would be to use an intrusive (to avoid
// allocations) MPSC queue (the consumer is the lock holder) with some
// sprinkling of atomics to wake threads up. Each `BlockedTask` would be stored
// in the nodes of the queue.
//
// This implementation is all fine and dandy for green threads (user space
// context switching is fast), but when implemented, it was found that this
// implementation was about 50x slower than pthreads for native threads.
//
// Upon profiling, nearly all time was spent in cvar signal/wait (that's how
// native threads implement deschedule/reawaken). The problem was never tracked
// down with 100% certainty, but it was able discovered that this huge slowdown
// was only on a multicore system, not a single core system. With this knowledge
// in hand, plus some idea of how pthread mutexes are implemented, it was
// deduced that the kernel essentially knows what's going on when everyone's
// contended on the same mutex (as in the pthreads case). The kernel can
// cleverly schedule threads to *not* wake up on remote cores because all the
// work needs to happen on the same core (that's the whole point of a mutex).
// The deschedule/reawaken methods put threads to sleep on localized cvars, so
// the kernel had no idea that all our threads were contending *on the same
// mutex*.
//
// With this information in mind, it was concluded that it's impossible to
// create a pthreads-competitive mutex with the deschedule/reawaken primitives.
// We simply have no way of instructing the kernel that all native threads are
// contended on one object and should therefore *not* be spread out on many
// cores.
//
// ## Mutexes, take 2
//
// Back do the drawing board, the key idea was to actually have this mutex be a
// wrapper around a pthreads mutex. This would clearly solve the native threads
// problem (we'd be "just as fast" as pthreads), but the green problem comes
// back into play (you can't just grab the lock).
//
// The solution found (and the current implementation) ended up having a hybrid
// solution of queues/mutexes. The key idea is that green threads only ever
// *trylock* and use an internal queue to keep track of who's waiting, and
// native threads will simply just call *lock*.
//
// With this scheme, we get all the benefits of both worlds:
//
// * Any flavor of task (even mixed) can grab a mutex, pthreads arbitrates among
//   all native and the first green tasks, and then green tasks use atomics to
//   arbitrate among themselves.
// * We're just as fast as pthreads (within a small percentage of course)
// * Native mutexes are statically initializeable, and some clever usage of
//   atomics can make the green halves of the mutex also statically
//   initializeable.
// * No destructors are necessary (there is no memory allocation). The caveat
//   here is that windows doesn't have statically initialized mutexes, but it is
//   predicted that statically initialized mutexes won't be *too* common. Plus,
//   the "free" happens at program end when cleaning up doesn't matter *that*
//   much.
//
// As you'll find out in the implementation, this approach cannot be fair to
// native and green threads. In order to soundly drain the internal queue of
// green threads, they *must* be favored over native threads. It was an explicit
// non-goal of these mutexes to be completely fair to everyone, so this has been
// deemed acceptable.
//
// This is the high-level implementation of the mutexes, but the nitty gritty
// details can be found in the code below.

/// This mutex is an implementation of a lock for all flavors of tasks which may

            // the unlocker and a locking green thread.
            //
            // One possible solution for this is to attempt to re-acquire the
            // lock during the unlock procedure. This is less than ideal,
            // however, because it means that the memory of a mutex must be
            // guaranteed to be valid until *all unlocks* have returned. That's
            // normally the job of the mutex itself, so it can be seen that
            // touching a mutex again after it has been unlocked is an unwise
            // decision.
            //
            // Another alternative solution (and the one implemented) is more
            // distasteful, but functional. You'll notice that the struct
            // definition has a `held` flag, which is impossible to maintain
            // atomically. For our usage, the flag is set to `true` immediately
            // after a mutex is acquired and set to `false` at the *beginning*
            // of an unlock.
            //
            // By doing this, we're essentially instructing green threads to
            // "please spin" while another thread is in the middle of performing
            // the unlock procedure. Again, this is distasteful, but within the
